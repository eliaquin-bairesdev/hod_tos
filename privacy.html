      <p><u>Types of Identifying Personal Information We Collect</u></p>

        <li>Federal Employer Identification Number</li>
      </ul>
      <p><u>Types of Non-Identifying Personal Information We Collect</u></p>
      <p>We may also collect non-identifying personal information such as your browser type,
        domain names, mobile device operating system, when you accessed the Service and from
        what location you access the Service. This information may be aggregated to measure the
        number of visits, average time spent, page views, and other statistics about users of
        the Service. We may use this data to monitor the Service&rsquo;s performance and to make
        the Service easier and more convenient to use.</p>
      <p>We collect personal information when you visit our Site, input information through the
        Service, complete a survey, receive customer or technical support, or when we connect
        you with a broker.</p>
    </div>
    <li id="Third_Heading"><strong><u>How We Use Your Personal Information</u></strong></li>
    <div>
      <p>The personal information you provide to us will allow us to communicate with you and
        provide the Service to you, depending on the aspects of the Service you utilize. This
        includes, but not limited to, connecting you to an insurance broker; customer service
        questions or issues; verifying your identity; and requesting feedback and upon your
        consent. We may also use your email address as part of the Service in sending you
        messages about the Service and other general announcements. We keep track of your
        interactions with us, including but not limited to your activity within the Service.
        Except as set forth in this Privacy Policy, or unless we have your consent, we will not
        share your personal information with any person or entity other than those affiliated
        with us, entities acting on our behalf, and relevant third parties such as those needed
        to collect and maintain our servers and perform technology and related services.</p>
      <p>We may use your personal information with non-personal information that we have collected
        in a manner such that the end-product does not personally identify you or any other user
        of the Service. We may make your personal information non-personally identifiable by
        either combining it with information about other users (aggregating your personal
        information with information about other users), or by removing characteristics (such as
        your name or email address) that make the information personally identifiable. This
        process is known as de-personalizing your information. You grant us a royalty-free,
        worldwide, perpetual, irrevocable and fully transferable right and license to use your
        personal information in connection with the creation and development of analytical and
        statistical analysis tools relating to the use of the customer data we collect in
        providing the Service (the &ldquo;<em>Analytical Data</em>&rdquo;). We are expressly
        authorized to make any commercial use of the Analytical Data, including without
        limitation, supplementing our valuation products, sharing the Analytical Data with third
        parties, and otherwise exploiting the Analytical Data, provided that we do not sell,
        trade, or otherwise transfer from us any part of the Analytical Data that personally
        identifies any Service users.</p>
      <p><u>Do Not Track</u></p>
      <p>In compliance with California legislation, AB370, effective January 1, 2014, our
        practices in responding to &ldquo;do not track&rdquo; signals and collecting user
        information over time and across a network of websites when you visit the Site are as
        follows: we do not honor the request of &ldquo;do not track&rdquo; signals sent by your
        browser when you visit the Site. Additionally, we may collect user information about
        your online activities over time and across different websites, or authorize third
        parties to do so.</p>
      <p><u>Google Analytics</u></p>
      <p>We use third-party service providers such as Google Analytics to help us learn about who
        visits the Site and what pages are being viewed. For more information about Google
        Analytics, please visit <a
          href="http://www.google.com/policies/privacy/partners/">www.google.com/policies/privacy/partners/</a>.
        You can opt out of Google Analytics' collection and use of data generated by your use of
        the Services by going to <a

      </p>
      <p><u>Cookies</u></p>
      <p>&ldquo;Cookies&rdquo; are small bits of electronic information that a website sends to a
        visitor&rsquo;s browser and are stored on the visitor&rsquo;s hard drive. Like many
        websites, we employ cookies in certain areas of the Site to allow us to provide
        information to make your online experience more convenient. For example, when you return
        to the Site after logging in, cookies provide information to the Site so that the Site
        will remember who you are on subsequent visits, speeding up or enhancing your experience
        of the Service by, for instance, tailoring content to you or keeping track of your login
        name and password. While we may use cookies to track your visit to the Site, this
        information does not identify you personally and you remain anonymous, even if you have
        previously submitted personal information to us through the Site or otherwise.</p>
      <p>Third parties whose websites are accessible through links on the Site may also use their
        own cookies when you link to their site or service. We do not control these third
        parties&rsquo; use of cookies and cannot guarantee that they will uphold the same
        privacy standards as us. We expressly disclaim any and all liability related to the
        collection, use or disclosure of information by third parties. You should review the
        privacy policies of any third-party sites that you visit through a link from the Site to
        understand how these third parties use cookies and the information they collect through
        cookies. Most cookies are &ldquo;session cookies&rdquo; which means that they are
        automatically deleted at the end of each session. Most browsers are initially set to
        accept cookies. You can set your browser to notify you when you receive a cookie, giving
        you a chance to decide whether or not to accept it.</p>
      <p><u>Log Information</u></p>
      <p>Our servers automatically record information that your browser or mobile device sends
        whenever you visit the Site or use the Service. This information includes, among other
        things, your Internet Protocol address, mobile device operating system, your browser
        type and version, which aspects of the Service you use and from where, and when and how
        long you use them. We use this information to monitor and analyze how users use the
        Service, to provide customer service and to maintain and improve the Service. We may
        also collect similar information from emails we may send to you which then help us track
        which emails are opened and which links are clicked by recipients. The information
        allows for more accurate reporting and improvement of the Service.</p>
      <p><u>Children&rsquo;s Privacy</u></p>
      <p>We do not knowingly collect personal information from children under 13 or allow them to
        create an account through the Site. We take children&rsquo;s privacy seriously, and
        encourage parents to play an active role in their children&rsquo;s online experience at
        all times.&nbsp;</p>

    <li id="Fourth_Heading"><strong><u>How We Share Your Information</u></strong></li>
    <div>
      <p><u>Sharing Your Information </u></p>
      <p>We use your personal information to provide the Service to you, handle your customer
        service questions or issues, request feedback, and send communications to you about

        personal information uploaded by you through the Service will be shared only with
        authorized persons to whom you specifically grant access or direct us to share with. We
        may also use your depersonalized personal information to provide analyses of our users
        in the aggregate (including Analytical Data subject to the terms of this Privacy Policy)
        to prospective partners and other third parties. We will also share the personal
        information we collect from you under the following circumstances, and you expressly
        authorize us to share your information as follows:</p>
      <ul>
        <li><em>Service Providers</em>. We may share your personal information with service
          providers (including our affiliates that provide services on our behalf) that we
          engage for the purpose of processing information on our and your behalf.
          Additionally, we may partner with other companies to process, analyze, and/or store
          data, including, but not limited to, Analytical Data. While providing services for
          us, these companies may access your personal information. To the extent applicable,
          we require these parties to comply with this Privacy Policy and appropriate
          confidentiality and security measures.</li>
        <li><em>Protection of Rights</em>. We will share personal information if we have a good
          faith belief that (i) access, use, preservation or disclosure of such information is
          reasonably necessary to satisfy any applicable law, regulation, legal process, such
          as a court order or subpoena, or a request by law enforcement or governmental
          authorities, (ii) such action is appropriate to enforce our Terms of Use for the
          Service, including any investigation of potential violations thereof, (iii) such
          action is necessary to detect, prevent, or otherwise address fraud, security or
          technical issues associated with the Service, or (iv) such action is appropriate to
          protect the rights, property or safety of us, our employees, users of the Service or
          others.</li>
        <li><em>Asset Transfers</em>. If we become involved in a merger, acquisition or other
          transaction involving the sale of some or all of our assets, user information,
          including personal information collected from you through your use of the Service,
          could be included in the transferred assets. You expressly consent to such transfer.
          Should such an event occur, we will use reasonable means to notify you through email
          and/or a prominent notice on the Site.</li>
      </ul>
      <p><u>Additional Information You Should Know About Third Parties</u></p>
      <p>The Service may contain direct links to websites operated by our partners and other
        entities. These third-party websites may collect information about you when you visit
        them or otherwise communicate with them. This Privacy Policy does not cover the
        information practices of third-party websites linked to the Site or accessible through
        the Service. Although we encourage such third parties to adopt and follow their own
        privacy policies, we are not responsible for their collection and use of your personal
        information. You should refer to the privacy policies and statements of other websites
        or contact the respective webmasters of those websites to obtain information regarding
        their information collection, use and disclosure policies.</p>

    <li id="Fifth_Heading"><strong><u>Your Rights and Choices Regarding the Your
      Information</u></strong></li>
    <div>
      <p><u>Control of Your Information</u></p>
      <p>You may update or delete your personal information or modify your account preferences for
        the Service by accessing the account interface provided through the Service. Please note
        that if you disable your account, we will keep the information we receive as described

        was collected, resolve disputes, establish legal defenses, conduct audits, pursue
        legitimate business purposes, enforce our agreements, and comply with applicable laws.
      </p>

    <li id="Sixth_Heading"><strong><u>How We Store and Safeguard Your Information</u></strong></li>
    <div>
      <p>The personal information that you provide to us is stored on servers which, to our
        knowledge, are located in secured facilities with restricted access and are protected by
        protocols and procedures designed to ensure the security of such information. We
        restrict access to personal information to our employees, independent contractors and
        agents who need to know this information in order to develop, operate and maintain the
        Service. All of our personnel who have access to this information are trained in the
        maintenance and security of such information. Access to such personal information is
        minimized whenever possible. Logs are kept of access to application data, which can be
        monitored for unauthorized activities. However, no server, computer or communications
        network or system, or data transmission over the Internet can be guaranteed to be 100%
        secure. As a result, while we strive to protect user information, we cannot ensure or
        warrant the security of any information you transmit to us or through the use of the
        Service and you acknowledge and agree that you provide such information and engage in
        such transmissions at your own risk. Once we receive a transmission from you, we will
        endeavor to maintain its security on our systems.</p>
      <p>In the event that personal information you provide to us is compromised as a result of a
        breach of security, when appropriate we will take reasonable steps to investigate the
        situation, notify you and take the necessary steps to comply with any applicable laws
        and regulations.</p>

      <p><u>Your Rights Under the CCPA</u></p>
      <p><strong><em>Right to Opt-Out of Sale of Your Personal Information</em></strong></p>
      <p>Consumers have the right to request that a business that sells the consumer&rsquo;s
        personal</p>
      <p>information, or that discloses it for a business purpose, inform the consumer of what has
        been collected about them and who it has been sold or disclosed to. Consumers also have
        the right, at any time, to direct a business that sells personal information about them
        not to sell their personal information.</p>
      <ul>
        <li>Help on Demand <u>does not sell or share your personal information</u> for monetary
          or other valuable consideration.</li>
      </ul>
      <p><strong><em>Right to Access / Data Portability</em></strong></p>
      <p>Consumers have the right to request that a business that collects personal information
        about them disclose the following: (1) The categories of personal information it has
        collected about that consumer; (2) The categories of sources from which the personal
        information is collected; (3) The business or commercial purpose for collecting or
        selling personal information; (4) The categories of third parties with whom the business
        shares personal information; (5) The specific pieces of personal information it has
        collected about that consumer. </p>
      <ul>
        <li>To exercise your right to access, you may submit a Verifiable Consumer Request by
          calling us toll free at 1-888-245-1922, and leave a message in the general mailbox,
          or by sending an email to privacy@helpondemand.com. Please include &ldquo;Request
          for Access&rdquo; in the subject line.</li>
        <li>If you submit your response via email, we will reach out within 10 days to confirm
          that we have received your request.</li>
        <li>We will then take steps to determine whether your request is a valid Verifiable
          Consumer Request. If you have an account, we may ask you to login to confirm this
          information. We will not ask you to create an account if you do not already have
          one. We will only ask for information that is reasonable in light of the nature of
          your request.</li>
        <li>When you submit a request for access: <ol>
          <li>Within 45 days, we will provide you with a copy of the information listed in
            &ldquo;Right to Access / Data Portability,&rdquo; above, by mail or
            electronically. To the extent possible, this information shall be provided
            in a portable and useable format.</li>
          <li>In the event we need additional time, we will inform you within the initial
            45-day period of our need for an additional 45 days (for a maximum of 90
            days between request and provision of information).</li>
          <li>We are not required to provide personal information to a consumer more than
            twice in a 12-month period.</li>
        </ol>
        </li>
      </ul>
      <p><strong><em>Right to Deletion</em></strong></p>
      <p>Consumers have the right to request that a business delete any personal information about
        them. However, there are exceptions to this rule. For example, a business does not have
        to delete information if it is necessary to: a) complete a transaction; b) prevent
        illegal activity; c) exercise free speech; d) comply with a legal obligation; e)
        identify or repair errors that impair functionality; or f) otherwise use a
        consumer&rsquo;s personal information, internally, that is compatible with the context
        in which the consumer provided that information.&nbsp;</p>
      <ul>
        <li>To exercise your right to deletion, you may submit a Verifiable Consumer Request by
          calling us toll free at 1-888-245-1922, and leave a message in the general mailbox,
          or by sending an email to privacy@helpondemand.com. Please include &ldquo;Request
          for Deletion&rdquo; in the subject line.</li>
        <li>We will reach out within 10 days to confirm that we have received your
          request.&nbsp;</li>
        <li>We will then take steps to determine whether your request is a valid Verifiable
          Consumer Request. If you have an account, we may ask you to login to confirm this
          information. We will not ask you to create an account if you do not already have
          one. We will only ask for information that is reasonable in light of the nature of
          your request.</li>
        <li>When you submit a request for deletion:</li>
        <ul>
          <li>If you have an account, you can log in to request deletion.&nbsp;</li>
          <li>For consumers that do not have an account, we have created a two-step process
            for responding to requests for deletion. After you submit the initial request,
            we will ask that you separately confirm that you would like your information
            deleted.</li>
          <li>If your request does not fall within one of the exceptions to deletion listed in
            &ldquo;Right to Deletion,&rdquo; above, we will confirm deletion within 45 days.
            If we are not required to delete your account, we also let you know within 45
            days.&nbsp;</li>
        </ul>
      </ul>
      <p><strong><em>Right to Non-Discrimination</em></strong></p>
      <p>A business cannot discriminate against a consumer because the consumer exercised any of
        the consumer&rsquo;s rights listed above.&nbsp;</p>
